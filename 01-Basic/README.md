# Basic Ansible NetDevOps

This lab assumes that you are using the Cisco DevNet Sandbox titled Cisco Modeling Labs (CML): Enterprise, 
although you can build this lab in your own environment using GNS3, CML, or Eve-NG.

This lab has three sections:    
- Ad-hoc commands (Using Ansible without playbooks)
- RAW Ansible module usage
- Simple inventory
- Simple playbooks
    - Variables
    - ios_command or ios_config modules

NOTE: These steps are not intended to be used in a production network. They are only offered as a guide for 
practicing in a lab environment.  Consult with an ansible professional for using ansible in production environments.

## Prerequisites

####sshpass

In this simple example we are going to have the DevBox prompt us for a password when accessing our inventory devices as 
opposed to storing them in either the inventory file or password vault.  in order to do this we must install **sshpass**
 onto the DevBox.  Enter the following command and follow prompts to install **sshpass**:
 
```
sudo yum install sshpass
```

## Configuration and Inventory File

Change into the 01-Basic directory.
```
cd 01-Basic
```
Ansible will use the .cfg file located in this directory it was running from if present otherwise it will default to the 
file located in the /etc directory.  

For our simple example we only want to make sure that host_key_checking = False.  

The inventory file however must be specified. It is stored as a YAML file with the 
.yml extension.

Look at the contents of the simple inventory that is included.  This inventory file will reference all of the IOS devices
in the sandbox lab.  Type the cat command to get the output
```
cat inventory.yml
```

Output of **inventory.yml**
```
[devnet_ios]
10.10.20.175
10.10.20.176

[devnet_nxos]
10.10.20.177
10.10.20.178
```

Notice that each of the devices are located under a grouping for the device type.  .175 and .176 which are both IOS-XE devices 
are specfied as **devnet_ios** whereas .177 and .178 are specified as part of the **devnet_nxos** group.

## Ad-hoc commands
Ansible can be used directly from the CLI that it has been installed using the `ansible` command.  For full details on 
command line options see the documentation of run ```ansible --help```.  

### Run basic show commands using the RAW module
Ansible RAW module (ansible.builtin.raw) is a ansible-core module included in all Ansible installations.  Per the 
documentation it *Executes a low-down and dirty SSH command' on a device.  The primary use case is for devices that don't 
have Python installed which should include almost all network equipment.  

We will be using the [Ansible RAW Module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/raw_module.html) 
in our first few examples from the CLI.   

#### Basic show commands
From the CLI of the DevBox run the following command.  The flags are as follows:

|Flag|Description|
|:---|:---|
|-m| Module used (using raw)|
|-a | Argument used |
| -u | Username |
| -k | prompt for password| 

Command structure for basic show commands
```
ansible <<hostname>> -m raw -a "<<command>>" -u <<username>> -k
```

1. Run a basic show command against a single device
    ```
    ansible 10.10.20.175 -m raw -a "show run" -u cisco -k
    ``` 

2. Change show command
    ```
    ansible 10.10.20.175 -m raw -a "show version" -u cisco -k
    ``` 

3. Run show command against inventory file
    - To run against the inventory file you must specify both the inventory file to be used as well as 
    the group you want to target.  The group **all** is a default group that includes all other groups.  
    ```
    ansible all -i inventory.yml -m raw -a "show version" -u cisco -k
    ```

4. Target group with show command in inventory file
    - Change the group **all** to group **devnet_ios**.
    ```
    ansible devnet_ios -i inventory.yml -m raw -a "show version" -u cisco -k
    ```
   
5. Extend ad-hoc commands with **grep**
   - Search for file version running by looking for specific output from 'show version' to capture for both IOS-XE and 
   NX-OS devices.  
   - Specify multiple search terms using ```\|``` to separate them.
   - NOTE: Added ```SUCCESS\|CHANGED\|``` to grep statement so we can see the line which shows the login status and hostname.
   ```
    ansible all -i inventory.yml -m raw -a "show version" -u cisco -k | grep 'SUCCESS\|CHANGED\|XE Software,\|NXOS image'
    ```
   
6. Extend ad-hoc commands with **grep**
   - Search for usernames in running by looking for specific output from 'show version' to capture for both IOS-XE and 
   NX-OS devices.  
   ```
    ansible all -i inventory.yml -m raw -a "show run" -u cisco -k | grep 'SUCCESS\|CHANGED\|username'
    ```

7. Send output to file.
   - Use LINUX command line to send output to a file.  GREP after file has been output
   ```
    ansible all -i inventory.yml -m raw -a "show run" -u cisco -k > show_run.txt
    ...
    <OUTPUT OMITTED>
    ...
    cat show_run.txt | grep 'username\|SUCCESS\|CHANGED'
   ```
   
8. Other non-privileged commands
   - Ping the same IP from multiple devices
   ```
    ansible all -i inventory.yml -m raw -a "ping 172.16.252.21" -u cisco -k
    ```
## Simple Playbooks - Beginning with cisco.ios.commands

Next step is to interact with Cisco devices much like we have, but using playbooks.  A playbook is a repeatable, re-usable 
config management/deployment file.  With [playbooks](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_intro.html) 
we can execute tasks, request command output, manipulate commands and more.  Ansible can use many modules from multiple 
vendors in playbooks but we will be using the [cisco.ios](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/cisco/ios/index.html)
 module in our playbook.  Three basic modules exist for interacting with Cisco IOS devices, ios_command, ios_config, and ios_facts.

Playbooks are saved into the appropriate folders in this directory structure.  Review the playbook for complete syntax 
and execute using the commands listed below.

playbooks are executed using the following command structure:

```
ansible-playbook <<group_name>> -i <<inventory_file>> <<playbook_name>>
``` 

### ios_command 
 [ios_command](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/cisco/ios/ios_command_module.html#ansible-collections-cisco-ios-ios-command-module)
  allows us to send arbitrary commands to the device and return results.  We can specify wait_for behavior to list conditions 
  before moving forward with a task.  This can be for a single line or other commands that require parent 
 configuration and then chid commands (e.g. acl name then acl entries). 
 
#### 01-run_show_version
Run a show version command on multiple devices

Playbook Excerpt
```
- name: run show version on remote devices

    commands: show version
```

Execute playbook
```
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml 01-run_show_version/main.yml
